## About

As a RPA developer, I am passionate about using cutting-edge technology to drive innovation and improve business processes. With a strong background in programming and expertise in tools such as UiPath and Automation Anywhere, I have helped clients across various industries streamline their operations and reduce the need for manual labor. Additionally, I program in several languages, including Python, and I am always looking for ways to stay at the forefront of the field by exploring emerging technologies.

Recently, I joined Leonardo as a Business Analyst, where I am using my skills to help the company drive innovation and Digital Transformation. I am excited to continue exploring the potential of RPA and other emerging technologies, and to use my skills to help organizations succeed.
